    <h2>A Special Message for my Baby's Special Day</h2>
    <p>
      Today, I want to celebrate not just your birthday, but everything that makes you so incredibly special to me. From the very first time we met at that festival—locking eyes in the crowd and smiling—I knew there was something about you that I couldn’t ignore. Even though we didn’t get that New Year’s kiss, fate had other plans for us.
      I still think back to our first proper date. I was so shy, I didn’t even know I felt such a way with you. Who knew we’d end up having a joint by a church and then watching Barbie together, laughing and cuddling through the night? Cutest dates ever. Those simple moments have meant the world to me.
      Then came the harder times, which we still handled like pros, like after your accident, when we found ourselves sharing hospital food and cuddling in that hospital bed we somehow made it fun. Even in those tough moments, being with you made everything feel better like we could get through anything as long as we were together. And when we went home, it felt like we’d faced something big and came out stronger.
      Every time we’re together, whether at festivals, playing games, or just curled up watching movies, you’ve brought so much joy into my life. Leaving at the airport was the hardest moment I’ve had, but I hold onto the belief that we’ll create even more memories, and that this is just a chapter in our story.
      I’ve seen how hard you work to improve your life, and I admire your determination and your heart. You inspire me in so many ways, and I am so proud of the person you are. I love how you care for the people in your life, how you make me laugh, and how you always make me feel seen, even when we’re far apart. You are truly one of a kind.
      Thank you for being my person. I can’t wait for the day we’re in the same place again, but until then, I’ll hold onto every memory, every laugh, every promise we’ve made to each other. Here’s to believing in us, and everything we’ll build together.
      Happy Birthday, my love. I love you more than words can ever say. 🎂🎉
